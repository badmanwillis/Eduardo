# Eduardo
Eduardo the hair combing robot, a University of Plymouth MEng Robotics ROCO504 project.

Olly Smith and Sam White 2018. Module lead by Martin F Stoelen.

##Abstract

People with temporary or permanent disabilities often struggle to perform daily tasks, and as a result, this loss of agency can cause undue emotional distress. For this project, we present “Eduardo”; a prototype robot arm designed with the intention of returning autonomy to the user. In particular, we utilise a passive compliant element in the end effector of the arm, to greatly simplify the control of the arm, and ensure the safety of the user during physical interaction. As a demonstration of the prototype, we have programmed the arm to comb hair, although we envision a wider range of potential applications.

From our research, this may well be the first prototype of assistive robot that features a passive compliant end effector.
